        I am a master's student in Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) at the
        University of Michigan (U-M). My interests are computer vision (CV) and
        machine learning (ML), especially their applications in medicine and
        robotics. I am a Graduate Student Instructor for ENGR 101, Introduction
        to Computers and Programming, where I teach first-year undergraduate
        students programming concepts in MATLAB and C++. I am also a research
        assistant at Michigan Medicine, where I leverage my knowledge in
        artificial intelligence (AI) to develop software that may potentially
        lead to better treatment of patients. During my undergraduate studies,
        I was a part of Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (MAAV) and
        Michigan Marching Band.
