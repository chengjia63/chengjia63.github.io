         <p>
        I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/computational-medicine-bioinformatics">
        Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics (DCMB) </a> at
        the University of Michigan. My interests are in computer vision and
        machine learning, especially representation learning and integrating
        observations from multiple modalities. I am a student researcher at <a
        href="https://hollon.lab.medicine.umich.edu"> Machine Learning in
        Neurosurgery Laboratory</a>, where I leverage my knowledge to develop
        software that may potentially lead to better treatment of patients.
        During my undergraduate studies, I was a part of Michigan Autonomous
        Aerial Vehicles (MAAV) and Michigan Marching Band.
