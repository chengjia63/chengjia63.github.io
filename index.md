        I am a master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University
        of Michigan (U-M). My interests are machine learning (ML) and computer vision
        (CV), especially their applications in medicine and robotics. 
        I am a Graduate Student Instructor for ENGR 101, Introduction to Computers and
        Programming, where I teach first-year undergraduate students programming
        concepts in MATLAB and C++. I am also a research assistant at the U-M Medical
        School, where I leverage my knowledge in artificial intelligence (AI) to
        develop software that can potentially lead to better treatment of patients.
        During my undergraduate studies, I was a part of Michigan Autonomous Aerial
        Vehicles (MAAV) and the Michigan Marching Band.
