title: About
---
I am a master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University
of Michigan (U-M). My interests are machine learning (ML) and computer vision
(CV), especially their applications in medicine and robotics. 
I am a Graduate Student Instructor for ENGR 101, Introduction to Computers and
Programming, where I teach first-year undergraduate students programming
concepts in MATLAB and C++. I am also a research assistant at the U-M Medical
School, where I leverge my knowledge in artificial intellengence (AI) to
develop software that can potentially lead to better treatment of patients.
During my undergraduate studies, I was a part of Michigan Autonomous Aerial
Vehicles (MAAV) and the Michigan Marching Band.
