Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health and socioeconomic problem
globally that is associated with a high level of mortality. Early and accurate
diagnosis and prognosis of TBI is important in patient management and
preventing any secondary injuries. Computer tomography (CT) imaging assists
physicians in diagnosing injury and guiding treatment. One of the clinical
parameters extracted from CT images is midline shift, a measure of linear
displacement in brain structure, which is correlated with TBI patient
outcomes. However, only a tiny fraction of the overall tissue displacement is
quantified through this parameter. In this paper, a novel measurement of
overall mid-surface shift is proposed that quantifies the total volume of
brain tissue shifted across the midline. When compared to traditional midline
shift, mid-surface shift has a stronger correlation with TBI patient outcomes.
